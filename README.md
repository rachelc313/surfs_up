# Surfs-Up Analysis

## Overview of the Analysis

"While on vacation in Hawaii last year, you discovered a newfound passion for surfing. You've been trying to create a plan that will let you not just return to Hawaii, but live there forever. You finally come up with an idea that you think is foolproof, a Surf and Shake shop serving surfboards and ice cream to locals, tourists, and of course, yourself.

You have some savings you're willing to invest, but we'll need some real investor backing to get this off the ground. So after putting together a strong business plan, you reach out to an investor, W. Avy, who is famous for his love of surfing. Your first meeting with him goes extremely well, but he has one concern, what about the weather?

He's extremely serious about this. He invested in a surf shop early in his career. However, he didn't ask for any weather analysis and that early venture was rained out of existence. W. Avy knows you've been learning how to properly analyze data and asks if you can run some analytics on a weather data set he has from the very island where you'd like to open your shop, the beautiful Awahoo."

An analysis was completed of the "hawaii.sqllite" file. The purpose of this analysis is the following:
